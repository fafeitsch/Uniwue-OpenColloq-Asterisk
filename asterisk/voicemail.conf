; NOTE: Asterisk has to edit this file to change a user's password.  This does
; not currently work with the "#include <file>" directive for Asterisk
; configuration files, nor when using realtime static configuration.
; Do not use them with this configuration file.
;
; NOTE: Mailboxes defined by app_voicemail MUST be referenced by the rest
; of the system as mailbox@context.  The rest of the system cannot add
; @default to mailbox identifiers for app_voicemail that do not specify a
; context any longer.  It is a mailbox identifier format that should only
; be interpreted by app_voicemail.

[general]
; Formats for writing Voicemail.  Note that when using IMAP storage for
; voicemail, only the first format specified will be used.
;format=g723sf|wav49|wav
format=wav49|gsm|wav
;
; WARNING:
; If you change the list of formats that you record voicemail in
; when you have mailboxes that contain messages, you _MUST_ absolutely
; manually go through those mailboxes and convert/delete/add the
; the message files so that they appear to have been stored using
; your new format list. If you don't do this, very unpleasant
; things may happen to your users while they are retrieving and
; manipulating their voicemail.
;
; In other words: don't change the format list on a production system
; unless you are _VERY_  sure that you know what you are doing and are
; prepared for the consequences.

[zonemessages]
; Users may be located in different timezones, or may have different
; message announcements for their introductory message when they enter
; the voicemail system. Set the message and the timezone each user
; hears here. Set the user into one of these zones with the tz= attribute
; in the options field of the mailbox. Of course, language substitution
; still applies here so you may have several directory trees that have
; alternate language choices.
;
; Look in /usr/share/zoneinfo/ for names of timezones.
; Look at the manual page for strftime for a quick tutorial on how the
; variable substitution is done on the values below.
;
; Supported values:
; 'filename'    filename of a soundfile (single ticks around the filename
;               required)
; ${VAR}        variable substitution
